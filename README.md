### Paranoid Archimedes
A chrome extension for deleting stale cookies.

#### Features
* All closed-tab cookies are deleted when you close a tab or click on the extension's icon.

#### Note
* The extension (currently) doesn't check the subdomains, thus it might cause usability issues for websites that heavily use cookies.

#### TODOs
* Make it less cruel (subdomain)
